# Southern High School Day \| Branded Photo Booth Activation for Student Recruitment

We had the opportunity to be part of something powerful at **Southern University’s High School Day**—a major campus event that brings thousands of high school students to experience life at Southern firsthand.

The goal? **Make an unforgettable impression** on the next generation of Jaguars.

And that’s exactly what we helped do—with a fully branded, high-energy [photo booth activation](/school-photo-booth-rentals) designed to engage students, promote school pride, and deliver custom content they could share instantly.

This wasn’t just a photo booth—it was a content hub, hype zone, and marketing moment all rolled into one.

## A Strategic Activation Built for Southern

We worked directly with Southern’s team to ensure the booth was placed at a high-traffic spot on campus—perfectly timed between sessions and performances. Our branded overlays matched the university’s aesthetic, and students immediately lined up to capture their visit.

The best part? Students walked away with branded keepsakes and photos that kept the **Southern University message** top-of-mind long after the buses left campus.

This is what we do best—**turning moments into marketing**, and fun into follow-through.

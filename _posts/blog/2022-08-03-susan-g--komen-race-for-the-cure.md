We were honored to be a part of this year’s Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure\! Susan G. Komen is the only organization that addresses breast cancer on multiple fronts such as research, community health, global outreach and public policy initiatives in order to make the biggest impact against this disease. This amazing organization’s efforts helped reduce deaths from breast cancer by 38 percent between 1989-2014\! Race for the Cure opted for Ohh Snap’s Bubbly Mermaid photo booth backdrop which fit seamlessly with the pink theme\! The runners had fun with Ohh Snap’s pink boa, sunglasses and enjoyed showing off their race numbers. We had a blast at this event\! Let us help make your next 5k or fundraiser a success\!

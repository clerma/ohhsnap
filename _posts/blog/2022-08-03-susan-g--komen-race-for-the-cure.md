# Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure \| Lafayette Fundraiser Photo Booth

We were honored to be part of the **Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure** in Lafayette—an event that brings hope, celebration, and awareness to the fight against breast cancer. The sea of pink, the energy of the runners, and the smiles of survivors and supporters made this day one we’ll never forget.

Our custom photo booth added a fun and meaningful touch to the event, giving participants a chance to snap photos with friends, family, and fellow supporters. The **Bubbly Mermaid backdrop** paired perfectly with the signature pink theme, and our collection of props—think pink boas, sunglasses, and message signs—kept the good vibes going all morning.

## Why Photo Booths Work for Charity Events

Photo booths do more than capture smiles—they amplify your cause.

* 🎗 **Raise Awareness** — Branded overlays and signage extend your message across social platforms
* 📸 **Drive Engagement** — Booths become a central point for fun and connection
* 💬 **Encourage Sharing** — Instant digital sharing lets supporters become advocates
* 💖 **Create Memories** — Survivors and families walk away with something meaningful
* 💡 **Add Value to Sponsors** — Logos and messaging gain visibility in every photo

Whether it’s a 5K, gala, walk, or benefit concert, we help create moments that matter—and media that travels far beyond your event.

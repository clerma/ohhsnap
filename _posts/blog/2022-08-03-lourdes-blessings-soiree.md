We were so thrilled to join Lourdes once again for their annual Lourdes Foundation Soiree. Lourdes Foundation raises money to help better serve those most in need in our community with health care, which makes this event extra special to us.

Lourdes chose our Bubbly back drop, which perfectly complemented this elegant event. Prop Box made some awesome custom props for this event, which included Lourdesâ€™s logo and a few speech bubbles that had quotes to match their Blessings Soiree theme. Our jumbo-sized balloons were a huge hit and added an extra, fun flare to the night. Ohh Snap had such a great time at Lourdes Blessings Soiree and we were honored to be a part of it again this year\! Until next year Lourdes.

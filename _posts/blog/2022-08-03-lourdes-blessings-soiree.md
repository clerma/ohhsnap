We were honored to once again join **Lourdes Foundation** for their annual **Blessings Soirée**, an event dedicated to raising funds that support access to compassionate health care for those most in need in our community.  

The evening was filled with elegance, generosity, and celebration—and our team was thrilled to help capture those moments through the lens of our **Ohh Snap Photo Booth**. Lourdes chose our **Bubbly backdrop**, a sparkling and sophisticated choice that perfectly complemented the event’s upscale atmosphere.  

Our friends at **[Prop Box](/)** created custom props featuring the **Lourdes logo** and themed speech bubbles to match the **Blessings Soirée** concept. The addition of **jumbo balloons** added a whimsical touch, making the booth an instant favorite among guests.  

It’s always a privilege to partner with organizations like Lourdes Foundation that do so much good for our region. Thank you for letting us play a small part in an incredible night of giving and joy. Until next year, Lourdes!

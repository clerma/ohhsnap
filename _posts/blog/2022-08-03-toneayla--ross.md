We had an amazing time celebrating with Toneayla and Ross at Le Pavillion in River Ranch this weekend\! Our gold-colored sequined photo booth backdrop added the perfect amount of sophistication to these photos. Not to mention, our custom peacock floral piece was a stunning, finishing touch

An open-air photo booth is an awesome way to capture the fun at any kind of wedding, and we had a blast at this one\! Congratulations Toneayla and Ross\!

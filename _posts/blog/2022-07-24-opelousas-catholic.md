We had such a great time with **Opelousas Catholic** this past weekend! Their **Mother-Son Dance** was full of laughter, energy, and sweet memories that perfectly captured the spirit of the night.  

The kids couldn’t get enough of **Ohh Snap’s superhero props**, and the crowd favorite? Definitely the **giraffe mask** — it made for some hilarious photos! Our **gold sequin photo booth backdrop** tied beautifully into the event’s theme and colors, adding just the right touch of sparkle to every picture.  

Events like this remind us how special it is to help families make memories together. Whether it’s a **school dance**, **homecoming**, or **fundraiser**, a **[School Photo Booth](/school-photo-booth)** adds a fun, interactive element that brings everyone together and captures the joy of the moment.  

We had a blast celebrating with Opelousas Catholic — can’t wait to see you all again in April!

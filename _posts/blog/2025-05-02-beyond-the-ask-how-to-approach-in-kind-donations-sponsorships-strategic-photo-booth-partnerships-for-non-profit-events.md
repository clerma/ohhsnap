# Beyond the Ask: How to Approach In-Kind Donations, Sponsorships & Strategic Photo Booth Partnerships for Non-Profit Events

When it comes to planning a successful fundraising event, the conversation can’t just start with **“Can you donate your services?”** Instead, the best events begin by asking deeper questions:

* What problem is this event solving?
* What does success look like—and how will we measure it?
* Do we have the right tools, partners, and capacity to make this happen?

At **Ohh Snap! Photo Booth**, we’ve worked with countless non-profits across Louisiana, and we’ve learned one major truth: **events aren’t a fundraising strategy—they’re a tool.** And when used intentionally, they can create real long-term value in the form of community visibility, donor engagement, and lasting impressions.

Whether it’s a gala, festival, donor dinner, or awareness walk, here’s how to approach photo booth partnerships (and other vendors) the smart way—and build events that leave impact far beyond the night-of.

## 🧠 Start With Strategy, Not Just a Vendor List

Before you start reaching out for donations, zoom out and ask:

* Why are we hosting this event?
* What’s the goal—raising money, building relationships, community visibility?
* What do our guests expect, and how can we make them feel valued?

These questions help you make **intentional decisions**—not just about decorations and entertainment, but about what tools will support your goals. Photo booths aren’t just fun—they’re an **experience that can be branded, interactive, and even capture donor data.**

---

## 🤝 How to Ask for In-Kind Donations the Right Way

If you’ve identified a vendor that aligns with your event goals, here are a few best practices before sending a donation request:

### Be Specific About the Impact

Don’t just say “We’d love a free photo booth.” Instead, explain how their presence contributes to the **guest experience** and **event success**.

Will it keep guests engaged between speeches?<br>
Drive visibility through social sharing?<br>
Give donors something they’ll take home and remember?

### Provide Exposure Value

Even if a vendor donates their services, they still have costs and time involved. Show them what they’ll get in return:

* Social media mentions
* Event signage
* Logo on printouts or the booth itself
* Inclusion in press releases or emails

### Acknowledge the Ask

Recognize that while you’re passionate about your cause, vendors receive **multiple requests each month**. Respect the “no” and be ready with another option (which we’ll cover below!).

## 💡 When In-Kind Isn’t Possible: Leverage Sponsorships Instead

At **Ohh Snap!**, we love working with non-profits—but we also know we can’t say yes to every in-kind request. That’s why we encourage organizations to **leverage our services as a sponsored activation**.

### Here's how that works:

✅ **You find a business aligned with your mission**<br>
Think local businesses, board members, or supporters who want to be seen as active community partners.

✅ **We customize the booth with their branding**<br>
From logos on the booth wrap, to custom prints, branded photo overlays, and sponsored galleries—**their brand gets premium placement** all while guests have fun.

✅ **Guests walk away with a keepsake AND a sponsor impression**<br>
People stick photo booth prints on their fridge, desks, and corkboards.<br>
Unlike banner signage, photos get **seen and remembered**—and reshared on social media for years to come.

> 📊 **Bonus**: With our **social booths** and **roaming photography**, we offer **data insights, contact collection**, and even **pre-filled social captions**, making your sponsor’s presence **truly measurable**.

## 🎯 Align the Booth with Your Event Goals

Photo booths can be more than just a line item. When integrated with your strategy, they can:

* Make guests feel special and valued
* Serve as a touchpoint for donor engagement
* Create a space for branding and messaging
* Collect useful data for future campaigns
* Enhance post-event follow-up (with a branded photo or email message!)

---

## 🔁 Don’t Forget the Follow-Up

One of the most powerful takeaways from any event happens **after it ends**. And the photo booth is one of the best ways to **keep the moment alive**:

* Send a follow-up email with their photo attached
* Include a thank-you and a reminder to support your mission
* Let sponsors reshare images with their audience for extended reach

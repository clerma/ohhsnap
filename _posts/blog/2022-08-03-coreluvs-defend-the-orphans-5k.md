Coreluvâ€™s goal is to provide local churches with creative resources and simple next steps for everyone to defend the orphan. With over 153,000,000 orphans in the world today, Coreluv believes in setting aside the entire month of November as Defend The Orphan Month and we were honored to be a part of the Defend the Orphan 5k run this year. Coreluv chose a step and repeat photo booth back drop with their logo on it and the runners chose to show off their medals as their props. We had a blast at this event\! Let us help make your next 5k or fundraiser a success\!&nbsp;

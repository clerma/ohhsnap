We were honored to partner with **Coreluv** for their annual **Defend the Orphans 5K**, an inspiring community event that raises awareness and support for children in need around the world. With over **153 million orphans globally**, Coreluv’s mission is simple yet powerful: to *defend the orphan* by equipping local churches and individuals to take action.  

For this year’s 5K, **Ohh Snap** provided a **custom step-and-repeat photo booth** featuring the **Coreluv logo**—a perfect way for runners, volunteers, and sponsors to celebrate their impact and share their photos online. Participants proudly posed with their **medals as props**, capturing not just a finish line moment but the heart behind the cause.  

Events like these are about more than just photos—they’re about **community, connection, and visibility**. A branded photo booth helps highlight **corporate sponsors**, increases **social media reach**, and creates a fun, interactive space that reflects your mission and message.  

If your organization is planning a **fundraiser, 5K, or charity event**, let **Ohh Snap** help turn it into a sponsorship-ready experience with **custom backdrops, logo integration, and instant digital sharing**.  

Learn more about our **[Non-Profit and Fundraiser Photo Booths](/corporate-photo-booth)** and see how we can help your next event engage donors, celebrate participants, and tell your story—one photo at a time.

# Kicking Off Mardi Gras with an Epic Photo Booth 🎭📸

Mardi Gras season in South Louisiana doesn’t ease in—it kicks the door open. And for many of us, it officially begins with the first round of **Krewe balls**.

From <a href="https://lakecharlesphotobooth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Charles</a> to <a href="https://alexandriaphotobooth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandria</a>, down to Houma, over to New Orleans and everywhere in between, Mardi Gras balls are where the season really comes alive. Whether the night leans formal and elegant or themed and playful, one thing is always true: **people show up ready**.

They’ve spent time picking out outfits. Coordinating looks with friends. Planning the night. And once the music starts and the dance floor fills up, the last thing anyone wants is a photo experience that feels like an afterthought.

That’s where an epic photo booth comes in.

## A Photo Booth That Matches the Energy of Mardi Gras

Mardi Gras balls today are about more than tradition. They’re about **getting dressed up, partying, and dancing with your people**. And when that’s the case, the photo booth should feel like part of the experience—not something tucked away in a corner.

A great Mardi Gras photo booth:

* Matches the tone of the event
* Handles high energy and high volume
* Captures both posed moments *and* spontaneous ones
* Lets guests walk away with photos that feel just as good as the night itself

That’s exactly how we kicked off this Mardi Gras season.

## Starting the Season with Some Legendary Krewes

### Krewe of Rio 2026 Ball

The **Krewe of Rio 2026 Ball** set the bar early. This is a large, well-established Krewe that knows how to throw a party—and do it with style.

Guests arrived dressed to the nines, ready for a formal night that quickly turned into a packed dance floor. It’s the kind of event where a clean, professional photo booth setup matters, because people expect photos that actually reflect the effort they put in.

### Krewe des Bon Amis XLVIII

On the more playful side, **Krewe des Bon Amis XLVIII** leaned fully into creativity. Hosted at Feed & Seed, this ball embraced costumes, personality, and a more intimate—but no less energetic—crowd.

These are the nights where friends show up ready to have fun, laugh, and capture moments they’ll still be talking about long after Mardi Gras is over.

## From Formal Balls to Themed Nights—Photos Matter

Some Mardi Gras balls are elegant. Some are themed. Some are a mix of both. But no matter the style, people come to celebrate—and they want photos that reflect that moment in time.

From **Mardi Gras balls in Lafayette**, to **Krewe events in Lake Charles**, to celebrations in **Alexandria, Houma, and across South Louisiana**, a professional photo booth helps set the tone and preserve the memories that make Mardi Gras what it is.

This season is just getting started—but if the kickoff is any indication, it’s already shaping up to be a good one.

We’re glad to be part of it. If you want to learn more about our booths a part of your Mardi Gras event. Check out our dedicated [Mardi Gras page](/mardi-gras-photo-booths).

What better way to kiss your 40’s goodbye than with an Ohh Snap photo booth? We had so much fun celebrating Bernise’s 50th birthday this weekend. The night was full of family, laugher and of course, silly pictures. Bernise chose our elegant, black sequin backdrop which went timelessly with the theme and colors. Prop Box made an array of custom props for the event, which included fun speech bubbles and themed 50’s quotes. An open-air photo booth is a fantastic way to celebrate any milestone, and we were happy to celebrate with Bernise\!

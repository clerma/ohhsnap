We had such a great time celebrating with **Giao and Mike** at **The VN in Abbeville** this weekend! This sweet couple’s wedding was filled with laughter, great music, and even a little karaoke — which they kindly invited us to join in on!  

For their photo booth, Giao and Mike chose **Ohh Snap’s gold sequin backdrop**, bringing a sophisticated glow to every photo. They kept it timeless with our **2x6 photo strips**, which guests absolutely loved as keepsakes.  

The real highlight of the night? Their custom **Pokémon-themed props** — including a pair of unforgettable **Pikachu glasses** that had everyone smiling.  

An **Ohh Snap [Wedding Photo Booth](/wedding-photo-booth)** is the perfect mix of fun and elegance for your big day — giving guests a reason to laugh, pose, and take home lasting memories.  

**Congratulations, Giao and Mike!** Thank you for letting us be a part of your incredible celebration!

We had an incredible time celebrating creativity at the **[American Advertising Awards](https://www.aaf.org/)** with **[AAF Acadiana](http://www.aafacadiana.com/)**! The **Acadiana ADDYs** bring together designers, marketers, and advertisers from across the region to honor the best in local advertising — and this year’s event did not disappoint.  

Held in true Acadiana fashion, the celebration combined sophistication with that unmistakable Louisiana flair. The theme of the evening, **“Order of the Eternal Eye,”** brought an air of mystery and fun that perfectly matched the energy of the creative community.  

To complement the event’s aesthetic, AAF Acadiana chose **Ohh Snap’s [Vegas Mermaid photo booth backdrop](https://ohhsnapbooth.com/photo-booth-and-photography-backdrops.html)** — a shimmering favorite that captured the room’s glow and the guests’ excitement. Our themed props, from masks to vintage pipes and cigars, were a huge hit and kept the laughter rolling all night.  

Corporate and industry events like this prove that photo booths aren’t just for weddings — they’re perfect for **team celebrations, award nights, and brand activations** that showcase your company culture in a creative way.  

We loved partnering with **AAF Acadiana** for such a fun and inspiring evening — and we can’t wait to capture more of Acadiana’s incredible talent next year!

We had so much fun at the&nbsp;[Acadiana AAAwards](http://addys2018.com/){: target="_blank"}\!&nbsp;[AAF Acadiana](http://www.aafacadiana.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;is an official chapter of the&nbsp;[American Advertising Federation](https://www.aaf.org/){: target="_blank"}, which is part of a nationwide network of movers, shakers and industry guardians. As home to professionals and students in the advertising, marketing, sales and public relations industry of Acadiana, they take pride in their work that’s reflective of the region’s unique reputation. Their creative energy thrives off of the festive atmosphere of Acadiana. AAF Acadiana chose to stick with an order of the eternal eye theme this year. It kept the whole night very mysterious and fun\! Acadiana AAF opted for Ohh Snap’s&nbsp;[Vegas Mermaid photo booth backdrop](https://ohhsnapbooth.com/photo-booth-and-photography-backdrops.html)&nbsp;which was perfect for this themed event. Our masks, pipes and cigars were this crowd’s favorite props. We love a good themed party and this one was definitely one of our favorites\!

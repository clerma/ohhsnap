We had such a great time celebrating the incredible **Bayshore Medical Center** staff this weekend! For more than **50 years**, Bayshore has served the Pasadena community with excellence — providing top-quality, compassionate care through their board-certified physicians, nurses, and healthcare professionals.  

To honor their hardworking team, Bayshore hosted an elegant **Great Gatsby–themed staff gala**, complete with dazzling décor and timeless class. They chose **Ohh Snap’s Champagne photo booth backdrop**, which paired perfectly with the evening’s glitz and gold tones.  

Of course, no Ohh Snap booth is complete without a few crowd favorites — and this group couldn’t get enough of our **Hulk prop**, which added a fun, lighthearted twist to the sophistication of the night.  

Corporate events like these are a perfect reminder that celebrations don’t just recognize success — they build morale, unity, and appreciation within the workplace. Whether it’s a **[Corporate Gala or Staff Appreciation Event](/corporate-photo-booth)**, an Ohh Snap photo booth brings energy, laughter, and unforgettable memories to every gathering.  

**Thank you, Bayshore Medical Center**, for letting us be a part of your celebration — and for all you do for your community!

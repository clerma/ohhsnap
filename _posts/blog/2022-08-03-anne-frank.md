We had a fantastic time at Anne and Frankâ€™s wedding. The reception was held outdoors at the UL Alumni Center and we were gushing over this beautiful venue. From the giant chandeliers hanging from the big oak trees to the hundreds of string lights, this wedding was absolutely stunning. The couple opted for our champagne-sequin photo booth backdrop which fit seamlessly with the theme of the wedding. The prop pick of the night was none other than our zebra mask\! This crowd was so much fun and knew how to have a good time. This wedding was simply gorgeous and we were so happy we got to be a part of it\! Congratulations, Anne & Frank, we wish you the best\!

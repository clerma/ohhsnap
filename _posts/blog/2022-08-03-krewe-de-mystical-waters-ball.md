It’s the **second most wonderful time of the year—Mardi Gras!** This weekend, we joined the **Krewe de Mystical Waters** for their annual ball, and the theme could not have been more epic: **Superheroes!**  

The room was filled with bold colors, laughter, and incredible energy as guests stepped up to the **Ohh Snap photo booth** to strike their best power poses. With **custom superhero props** crafted by our friends at **Prop Box** and our **red sequin backdrop**, the setup matched the night’s theme perfectly—bright, bold, and unforgettable.  

Every Mardi Gras Ball has its own magic, but what makes them truly special is capturing your **krewe at their finest**—dressed to impress, surrounded by friends, and celebrating the spirit of the season. Our photo booths make that possible with studio-quality lighting, themed props, and instant digital sharing that keeps the fun going long after the parade ends.  

Whether your krewe is planning a **masquerade gala, themed ball, or private celebration**, Ohh Snap is here to help you **capture the night in style**.  

Book your **[Mardi Gras Photo Booth](/holiday-photo-booths)** and make next year’s celebration one your krewe will never forget!

We had a great time celebrating with Giao and Mike at the VN in Abbeville this weekend. This couple was so sweet and even asked us to join in on the karaoke\! Our gold-colored sequined photo booth backdrop added the perfect amount of sophistication to these photos. Giao and Mike opted to keep it classic with our 2x6 photo strips, which the guests loved. The favorite props of the night were a few they provided, Pok√©mon glasses. An open-air photo booth is an awesome way to capture the fun at any kind of wedding, and we had a blast at this one\! Congratulations Giao and Mike\!

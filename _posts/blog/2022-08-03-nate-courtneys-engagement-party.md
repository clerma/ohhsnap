We kicked off the new year with a celebration full of joy, laughter, and love at **Nate and Courtney’s engagement party** hosted at [Reve Coffee Roasters](https://revecoffeeroasters.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The energy was contagious as friends and family gathered to toast to the happy couple—and capture every memory along the way.  

For this special night, the couple chose our **Snap Social Booth**, a sleek and modern setup perfect for parties where fun and style meet. Guests took full advantage of its **boomerang, filter, and GIF features**, creating share-worthy moments that fit the New Year’s Eve vibe perfectly.  

The booth was decked out with **festive props**, from classy New Year’s accessories to party horns, adding a touch of sparkle to every shot. Each GIF became an instant favorite—shared, saved, and replayed long after the clock struck midnight.  

If you’re planning an **engagement party, holiday event, or New Year’s celebration**, our [Snap Social Booth](/booths/social-photo-booth) is a simple, modern, and fun way to bring your guests together for unforgettable content and candid laughter.

Cheers to Nate and Courtney—and to making every celebration a little more memorable with Ohh Snap!

A day surrounded by pups is always a day well spent! 🐾  
We had an incredible time capturing **families and their furry friends** at **Bark in the Park** at **Grand Central Park**. Events like these remind us that animals are more than just pets — they’re family — and documenting those bonds is one of our favorite things to do.  

For this event, we set up a **woodgrain backdrop** with plenty of **pet-friendly props** to make each photo unique and fun. Our favorite guests? A five-year-old little girl and her gentle **Great Dane best friend** — a perfect reminder of the joy that happens when community and compassion come together.  

Community events like **Bark in the Park** are such a great way to bring people (and their pets!) together. Whether it’s a local fundraiser, adoption day, or pet-friendly festival, an **Ohh Snap [Community Photo Booth](/event-photo-booth)** helps create genuine connections and timeless memories.  

Here’s to all the wagging tails and smiling faces — until next year, Bark in the Park!

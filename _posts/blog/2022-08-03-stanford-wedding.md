We had such a fantastic time with Mr. and Mrs. Stanford on their big day\! The Crossing at Mervin Kahn’s rustic feel really set the tone for the reception. Ohh Snap booth fit seamlessly into this couple's rustic theme with our champagne, sequined photo booth backdrop. Not to mention, the guests couldn’t get enough of our unicorn mask\! Our open air photo booth is an awesome way to keep the smiles coming all night long at any kind of wedding reception, and we were stoked to be a part of the Stanford’s big night. Congratulations\!

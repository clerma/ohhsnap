There’s no better way to spend a Saturday night than celebrating with the fun-loving women of **Phi Mu**!

Their **semi formal event at Jefferson Street Pub in downtown Lafayette** set the scene for a night of laughter, dancing, and unforgettable memories. With a venue full of energy and excitement, we were honored to be part of the celebration.

Phi Mu chose our **silver sequin backdrop** for their photo booth setup—glamorous, reflective, and perfect for party pics. Add in a table full of **fun and silly props**, and the result? A non-stop stream of candid, creative photos their members will be looking back on for years.

We loved capturing the spirit of **sisterhood, celebration, and style**. Thanks for having us, Phi Mu—can’t wait to do it again soon!

Want to bring this same level of energy and fun to your next **sorority event or formal**? [Check out our booths here](/booths) and let’s make it unforgettable.

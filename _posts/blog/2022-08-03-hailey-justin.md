We were so excited to capture the love and laughter at **Hailey and Justin’s** beautiful wedding! Hosted at **Maison de Tours** in **St. Martinville, Louisiana**, this celebration perfectly combined rustic charm with timeless elegance.  

The couple tied their décor together with **Ohh Snap’s gold sequin photo booth backdrop**, adding a touch of sparkle that complemented the venue’s **iconic fountain and brick courtyard**. Guests had a blast using our **classy wedding props**, creating keepsake photos that will be cherished for years to come.  

Our photo booth kept the energy going all night long, giving everyone a fun way to capture candid, joy-filled moments. From the bride’s radiant smile to the dance-floor laughter, this rustic Louisiana wedding was nothing short of magical.

We had such a great time celebrating **Kyle and Brittany** at their breathtaking wedding at **Sunny Meade**! From the lush **greenery and hanging florals** to the **string lights draped across the ceiling**, every detail created the perfect romantic setting.  

To match their elegant design, the couple chose **Ohh Snap’s silver sequin photo booth backdrop**, adding a touch of sophistication that shimmered beautifully under the lights. The photos were as timeless as the night itself — filled with laughter, joy, and a few unforgettable poses!  

Weddings like this remind us why we love what we do. It’s more than a booth — it’s a space for your guests to celebrate, laugh, and capture memories that last long after the last dance.

**1\. Yes, this will be the best day of your life, but chaos and stress come with the good.&nbsp;**Bridal shows are the perfect way to lift a load off you from digging around the internet and asking Facebook for suggestions and opinions. You can go to a show and have a wide variety of options right at your fingertips and also form your own opinions and get a taste for yourself.

**2\. Options, options, options\!&nbsp;**I don’t know about you, but having several different options puts my mind at ease. You may find a vendor that none of your friends or friends have experienced before and totally fall in love with them. Not to mention, a lot of these vendors are out showing their latest and greatest trends. Who doesn’t want to be ahead of the upcoming trends?

**3\. They’re inexpensive.**&nbsp;Bridal shows range from maybe $15- $40 depending on your area and how big the show is. You pay a small fee to personally experience these vendors, get pampered, try tastings and let’s not forget about the free champagne.

**4\. Who loves a good deal?**&nbsp;Most of the vendors at these bridal shows are there offering steep discounts. Take advantage of those discounts, because expenses add up quickly\! Oh\! And don’t forget about all of the awesome prizes they give away, including wedding dresses and honeymoons\!

**5\. Girls day out\!**&nbsp;Bring out your bridesmaids, friends and family and make a day out of it\! It’s one extra occasion to spend some quality time together and have a fun day\!

We were honored to be part of **Houston’s Society for Marketing Professional Services (SMPS) Design Award Gala** — a night celebrating creativity, leadership, and community impact across the **architecture, engineering, and design industries**.  

This event was especially meaningful because all proceeds benefited **[Casa de Esperanza de los Niños](https://www.casahope.org/)**, a Houston-based organization providing safe, nurturing homes for children in crisis. Their mission to break the cycle of abuse and restore hope is one we’re proud to support.  

To match the evening’s elegant atmosphere, SMPS chose **Ohh Snap’s silver sequin photo booth backdrop**, paired with timeless and playful props that encouraged everyone to let loose and celebrate. Our photo booth captured the spirit of the night — professionals laughing, connecting, and commemorating a meaningful cause together.  

Whether it’s a **corporate awards gala, fundraiser, or networking event**, a **[Corporate Photo Booth Activation](/corporate-photo-booth)** is the perfect way to blend sophistication with fun while creating branded memories your guests will love.  

We had an incredible time supporting **SMPS Houston** and **Casa de Esperanza** — and can’t wait to see the continued impact this group brings to the Houston community.

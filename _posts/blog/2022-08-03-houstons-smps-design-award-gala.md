This weekend we were honored to be a part of Houston’s Society for Marketing Professional Services Design Award Gala. SMPS is a group of marketing and business development professionals from architectural, engineering, planning, interior design, construction, and specialty consulting firms. SMPS’ mission is to advocate for, educate, and connect leaders in the building industry.

This event was dear to us because all of the proceeds from the gala went to Casa de Esperanza de los Ni&ntilde;os – the House of Hope for Children. Casa de Esperanza is a safe place for children in crisis due to abuse, neglect or the effects of HIV. The organization strives to break the destructive cycle of child abuse by offering safe homes to the children of families in crisis free of charge.

SMPS opted for Ohh Snap’s elegant and simple silver sequined back drop with some classic, fun props. Ohh Snap’s Photo Booth fit perfectly with this event and we had a blast supporting this awesome Houston organization.

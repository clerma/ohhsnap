We kicked off the new year in style with [Ruffino’s on the River](https://ruffinosrestaurant.com/lafayette/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}—bringing the perfect blend of celebration and content to their New Year's Eve party!

Known for their motto “Make It Memorable,” Ruffino’s went all-in with a fully branded [Ohh Snap photo booth](/holiday-photo-booth). Guests posed in front of our dazzling Vegas Mermaid backdrop, using custom props made by Prop Box, including the restaurant’s own hashtags like **#MakeItMemorable** and **#CelebrateLife**.

To match the high-energy vibe of the night, we provided both a social sharing kiosk and instant prints—giving guests fun takeaways while boosting real-time engagement online.

From intimate restaurant events to large-scale celebrations, our [holiday and NYE photo booth rentals](/holiday-photo-booth) help you ring in the new year with unforgettable memories and high-impact content. Thanks for celebrating with us, Ruffino’s!

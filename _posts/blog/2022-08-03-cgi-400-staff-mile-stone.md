A company milestone isn’t just about the number — it’s about the *people* who made it happen. This weekend, we had the honor of celebrating with **CGI** as they reached an incredible goal of **400 team members** across our community and beyond!  

To mark the occasion, CGI hosted a **Mardi Gras–themed celebration** filled with vibrant colors, high energy, and plenty of Louisiana flair. They chose **Ohh Snap’s gold sequin photo booth backdrop**, which perfectly matched the festive mood of the night. From **masks and boas to branded props**, every photo captured the joy and unity of a team that truly knows how to celebrate success together.  

At Ohh Snap, we believe that **company milestone celebrations** aren’t just about the accomplishment—they’re about the *morale* that comes from reaching a goal together and documenting those memories.  

Our **[Corporate Photo Booths](/corporate-photo-booth)** make it easy to capture those authentic moments of connection—boosting company culture and giving your team something to look back on long after the party ends.  

Here’s to CGI and the incredible milestone they achieved. Until next time, keep celebrating your wins—big and small—with a smile!

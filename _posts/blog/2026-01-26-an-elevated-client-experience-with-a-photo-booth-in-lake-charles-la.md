# An Elevated Client Experience with a Photo Booth in Lake Charles, LA

When companies host client appreciation events, the goal is simple—but meaningful: make people feel valued. Not marketed to. Not rushed through a program. But genuinely appreciated for the relationship they’ve built.

That was exactly the intention behind the recent client appreciation event hosted by **Stine Tax & Wealth Management** in **Lake Charles, Louisiana**, and it was our pleasure to help bring that vision to life.

## From the Mayor’s Election to a Client Celebration

Stine Tax & Wealth Management already understood the impact of a polished photo experience. They had previously seen on-site photo printing in action during the mayor’s election—an event where the photo booth experience needed to feel professional, intentional, and elevated.

When it came time to host their own client appreciation event, the request was clear:

Create an experience that feels just as elevated as the mayor’s event—something refined, thoughtful, and aligned with the level of service we provide our clients.

That trust meant a lot to us.

## Designing a Photo Booth That Matched the Invitation

Every detail of the evening was carefully considered, including the photo booth experience. Stine’s team asked for a setup that followed the **look, feel, and information of their event invitation**, ensuring the booth felt like a natural extension of the celebration—not a distraction from it.

From the clean, elegant layout to the intentional design choices, the goal was to create something timeless. With **on-site photo printing**, guests were able to leave with a physical keepsake—something tangible that reflected the care and effort put into the evening.

## Making Clients Feel Like Valued Partners

This event wasn’t about entertainment for entertainment’s sake. It was about connection and appreciation.

By offering a refined photo booth experience, Stine Tax & Wealth Management created a moment where guests felt seen, celebrated, and valued. The photos weren’t just souvenirs—they were reminders of a relationship built on trust and long-term partnership.

For us, that’s what a great corporate photo booth experience should do: quietly elevate the room and leave people feeling like they matter.

# How Ohh Snap Compares to Other Lafayette Photo Booth Rentals

If you’ve started searching for a photo booth in Lafayette or anywhere in Louisiana, you’ve probably noticed something pretty quickly—there are a lot of options. At first glance, many photo booth companies might seem similar. They all promise fun photos, instant sharing, and memorable experiences. But when you dig deeper, the differences become clear.

At Ohh Snap! Photo Booth, we believe in transparency. We’re not the cheapest option, and we’re upfront about that. But we also believe you deserve to know exactly what sets us apart from other photo booth companies in Louisiana—so you can make the best decision for your event.

---

## Custom Design for Every Single Event

**What others offer:** Many photo booth companies provide a small library of pre-made templates or themes. You select one from a catalog, and it’s applied across every event—whether it’s a wedding for 200 guests or a small birthday party.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Every single rental—regardless of size or budget—receives a custom-designed layout created by our in-house graphic design team. We don’t rely on templates. Instead, we design with intention—matching your event’s colors, tone, venue, and overall experience.

But customization goes beyond graphics.

We consider where the booth lives in the room, how lighting interacts with attire and skin tones, how guests move through the space, and how the booth should feel within the flow of the event. That level of customization comes from experience—not presets.

**Why it matters:** Your event is unique. Your photos should be too. True customization ensures your wedding doesn’t feel like a corporate activation, and your brand event doesn’t feel generic or disconnected.

---

## Transparent Pricing from the Start

**What others offer:** Many photo booth companies require you to fill out a contact form or call for pricing. Some show starting prices but don’t reveal what’s actually included until you’re deep into the sales process.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Our pricing is clearly displayed on our website for every booth type. Our Portrait Booth packages start at $500 (Basic), $700 (PLUS), and $900 (Ultimate)—and we list exactly what’s included in each package. No surprises. No hidden fees.

**Why it matters:** You can budget accurately from day one. You’re not wasting time requesting quotes for services outside your price range, and you know exactly what you’re getting for your investment.

---

## Professional Photography Equipment & Expertise

**What others offer:** Some photo booth operators don’t come from a photography background and rely solely on manufacturer defaults. When lighting conditions change or technical issues arise, results can be inconsistent.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Ohh Snap! was founded by Carlos and Ashley Lerma, a husband-and-wife team with professional photography and graphic design backgrounds. We use professional-grade equipment and, more importantly, understand how to use it in real-world event environments.

When challenges arise, we know how to adjust on the spot—maintaining consistent, studio-quality images throughout the night.

**Why it matters:** Better equipment paired with photography expertise results in better photos. Your guests aren’t just receiving “booth photos”—they’re walking away with images they’re proud to keep and share.

---

## More Prints, More Value

**What others offer:** Many competitors limit prints to one or two per guest, cap the total number of prints, or charge extra for additional copies.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:**

* **PLUS Package:** Up to 400 custom prints included
* **Ultimate Package:** Unlimited custom prints

**Why it matters:** Your guests can take home multiple copies—one for themselves, one for family, one for the fridge. No one has to choose between keeping a photo or giving it away. More prints mean more memories shared.

---

## Backdrops & Props Included in Every Package

**What others offer:** Some photo booth companies charge extra for backdrops or limit prop selections unless you upgrade.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Backdrops and props are included in all Portrait Booth packages—Basic, PLUS, and Ultimate. We also offer premium upgrades like 5D Flower Walls, Boxwood Hedge Walls, and high-end collaborative backdrop designs.

More importantly, we help guide the selection. The backdrop isn’t just décor—it’s the foundation of the photo. Choosing the right one depends on lighting, attire, and the overall aesthetic of your event.

**Why it matters:** The backdrop makes up the majority of every photo. Including it—and choosing it intentionally—means better images without surprise add-on costs.

---

## Analytics, ROI Reporting & Complete Event Galleries

**What others offer:** You receive your photos after the event—usually a download link—and that’s where it ends.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** We offer optional analytics reporting, including total captures, number of shares, estimated reach, and print counts—perfect for corporate events and brand activations.

Beyond that, we proudly display every event we’ve ever done since day one. Guests can retrieve their photos whether the event happened last weekend or years ago.

**Why it matters:** You’re not guessing—you have real data and long-term access to your memories.

---

## Trusted by Major Brands & Featured in Industry Press

**What others offer:** Local reputation and word-of-mouth referrals—which are valuable and important.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** We’ve partnered with Amazon, Aflac, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Tabasco, Ochsner, and more. We’ve also been featured in Style Me Pretty and trusted by planners, venues, and organizations across Louisiana.

**Why it matters:** Major brands require reliability, professionalism, and consistency. That same standard applies to every wedding and event we serve.

---

## More Booth Options for Every Type of Event

**What others offer:** One or two booth options, often applied to every event type.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:**

* Portrait Booth
* Social Booth
* 360 Photo Booth
* Roaming Photo Booth
* Virtual Photo Booth

**Why it matters:** Different events need different solutions. We help you choose the right experience—not just the most popular one.

---

## Service Specialization for Your Event Type

**What others offer:** One-size-fits-all service for every event.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Specialized experience for weddings, corporate events, schools, nonprofits, and large-scale celebrations—each with different goals and needs.

**Why it matters:** A prom, a wedding, and a corporate gala should never be treated the same.

---

## Full-Time Operation with Faster Response Times

**What others offer:** Part-time operations or side businesses with limited availability.

**What Ohh Snap! offers:** Ohh Snap! is a full-time photo booth company, offering responsive communication, proper insurance, dependable staffing, and dedicated support before, during, and after your event.

**Why it matters:** When plans change or venues require documentation, you need a vendor who’s available and prepared—not one juggling another job.

---

## The Bottom Line: You Get What You Pay For

We’re not the cheapest photo booth company in Lafayette—and we’re okay with that.

What you get instead:

* Custom design for every event
* Professional photography expertise
* More prints included
* Backdrops and props in every package
* Analytics and long-term galleries
* Trusted partnerships and industry recognition
* Multiple booth options
* Full-time support and proper insurance

If you’re looking for the cheapest option, we may not be the right fit. But if you’re looking for a professional, custom, and intentional photo booth experience—we’d love to work with you.

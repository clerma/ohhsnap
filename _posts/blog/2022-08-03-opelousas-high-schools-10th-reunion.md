There is something about a high school reunion that makes people come alive. Getting to relive great memories as they dance the night away. We loved seeing people rush up to the booth with their old friends and putting on those fun props\! Opelousas chose to customize their props for the class of 2007, 10 year reunion. Our array of photo booth props did not disappoint the crowd\! The “I think I dated her” sign was especially a favorite. The black sequined backdrop provided the finishing touch to tie in the school's orange and black colors. With Ohh Snap, our open air photo booth is a great addition to any kind of reunion or event, and we were so excited to be a part of this one\! Until next time OHS.

There’s something unforgettable about a **high school reunion**—especially when it’s packed with music, memories, and photo-worthy moments.

**Opelousas High School’s Class of 2007** hosted their **10-year reunion** and brought the house down with laughter, dancing, and a personalized photo booth experience. Classmates reconnected while snapping photos with custom **Class of 2007 props**, including crowd favorites like the “_I think I dated her_” sign.

We paired their nostalgic vibes with a sleek **black sequin backdrop** to match OHS’s orange and black school colors, making each photo a perfect keepsake. These printouts often end up on office desks and fridges, serving as sweet daily reminders of friendships that never faded.

Planning your own school reunion? A photo booth adds the perfect blend of **fun, entertainment, and content creation**. [Explore our school event options](/school-photo-booth) to see how we can help you celebrate your milestone in style.

Thanks for having us, OHS. Until next time!

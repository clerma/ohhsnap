Rescheduling an event can be stressful, and while we’re always here to help, we want to help you understand why rescheduling isn’t always as simple as just picking another date. When you book a vendor for your event, you’re not just booking their products or services; you're reserving a specific date. The date itself is what we’re really booking—it's our limited inventory. Once you’ve reserved your date with us, it's no longer available for other clients to book.

As you can imagine, with only 52 weekends in a year, we have very limited availability, and weekends tend to be the most sought-after time. This means that when an event gets rescheduled, the original date is lost. For many vendors, including **Ohh Snap!**, once that date is taken off the calendar, it’s gone. Just like when you buy a limited-edition item, that date is now yours, and it's off the market for anyone else.

### Why Are Rescheduling Fees Common?

When you reschedule your event, you’re essentially booking another date, which is another product. While we do our best to accommodate, rescheduling means we’re effectively giving you two events for the price of one, which is why some vendors, including us, charge a rescheduling fee. It helps us stay in business, and while it's not as much as the full service price, it's there to help cover the time and resources lost by having to change the date.

Most vendors do not offer refunds when a cancellation occurs, especially if it’s close to the event date. The closer to the event, the less likely it is we can book that spot again, meaning we’re unable to resell the service to another client. This is why you’ll often find cancellation fees or the full balance due, depending on how close to the event date the cancellation occurs.

At **Ohh Snap!**, we understand that rescheduling is not ideal for anyone. It’s not a situation anyone wants to be in, but we want to work with you as best as we can to help make your event happen on another date. We are a small business, and like many event vendors, we absolutely love what we do, and we strive to make every event special.

### What About the Contract?

Important disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer, so please consult one if you need specific legal advice.

That said, most contracts include a **Force Majeure** or "acts of God" clause. This clause generally means that if something unpredictable happens (like a natural disaster or a health emergency), and it makes it impossible for us to perform our duties, we are not in breach of contract. In the case of rescheduling, this clause typically says that both parties (the couple and the vendor) need to resume obligations once the unforeseen event is over, meaning the wedding or event is just moved to another date, not cancelled.

However, please understand that no vendor wants to lose the opportunity to provide their services to you, but events like these affect our ability to schedule new clients. If we give away services for free by rescheduling, we face financial losses that can impact our ability to keep our business running. We love what we do, but like any business, we must also make sure we can keep operating to continue providing excellent services to all our clients.

### Rescheduling: Understanding & Empathy Go a Long Way

We know it’s disappointing to have to move your event date, and it’s not just hard for you—it’s tough for us too! We’re not in this industry to make a fortune; we’re here because we love making memories for people and being a part of special days. We understand the hardship of having to reschedule, and we hope you’ll empathize with our position too.

When we ask for a rescheduling fee or cancellation payment, it’s not because we want to take advantage of the situation, but because it helps us stay afloat and keep providing you with the high-quality service that **Ohh Snap!** is known for. We work tirelessly to give you the best experience, and this process helps us do that.

If you need to reschedule, we’ll do everything in our power to make it work. Let’s find a new date together and ensure that your event, no matter when it happens, is a fantastic one. We promise to continue working hard to deliver the amazing photo booth experience you’ve imagined!

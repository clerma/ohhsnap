Yes, when you book any of our booths—be it a digital booth, portrait booth, or 360 booth—the person who made the reservation will receive all the digital photos. Additionally, we host a public <a href="https://gallery.ohhsnapbooth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Ohh Snap Photo Booth Gallery">gallery</a> where your guests can easily access their images and purchase additional prints. Thanks to the high quality of our photos, many guests are excited to acquire larger sizes or different formats for their favorite shots. Our gallery makes it easy for them to explore these options without adding any extra hassle for you!

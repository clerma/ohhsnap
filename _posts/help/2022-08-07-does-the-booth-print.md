The answer is: it depends on the type of booth you choose! At Ohh Snap, we offer a variety of photo booths to suit different event needs.

Our Social Booth and 360 Booth are designed with a digital focus, which means they do not include print options. These booths are perfect for capturing and sharing moments instantly, allowing guests to access their photos digitally via email or social media.

On the other hand, our Portrait Booths and Roaming Photography services do offer printing options. Depending on the package you select, there are specific print limits, but we generally recommend the standard 4x6 prints for a classic look. If you're looking for something different, we also provide 2x6 strips and other paper sizes upon request!

Whether you prefer digital sharing or tangible keepsakes, we have options that cater to your preferences, ensuring your event is memorable and enjoyable for all your guests. If you have any further questions about our printing capabilities or would like to discuss your specific needs, feel free to reach out!

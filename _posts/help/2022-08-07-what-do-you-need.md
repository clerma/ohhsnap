### Do You Need Anything for Your Event?

Yes! To ensure everything runs smoothly, there are a few things we’ll need at your event:

1. **Power Source:** We require nearby access to a power outlet to keep our equipment running.
2. **Space:** A minimum of 10x10 feet of space is needed for our Portrait booth setup and 20x20 for the 360 booth. This space must be indoors or covered. If the event is outdoors, please let us know in advance, and ensure the ground is stable and dry. Additionally, the setup area should be safe for both our staff and equipment.
3. **Wi-Fi and Cell Service:** While we can provide our own Wi-Fi, reliable cell service can help prevent any delays. Please note, cell service is not always guaranteed, so having it available at your event helps ensure smooth operation.
4. **Table for Props:** We’ll need a dressed table to display props for your guests. If one isn’t available, please let us know beforehand, and we can make alternate arrangements.

Ensuring these details are taken care of helps us deliver a seamless, fun experience for your event! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out—we're here to help!

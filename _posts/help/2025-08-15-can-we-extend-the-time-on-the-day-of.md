Yes, you can absolutely extend your photo booth rental—**as long as we don’t have another booking right after yours** and our team is available!

We totally understand that sometimes the booth becomes the life of the party and no one wants the fun to end. Whether it’s a packed dance floor or a long line of guests still snapping photos, we’re happy to keep the experience going if we can.

## How to Request More Time

While it’s ideal to request additional time **a few days before your event**, we know things can change in the moment. If you're mid-event and realize you'd like to keep the booth open longer, just let our Ohh Snap attendant know. They'll contact our team at headquarters to:

* Confirm there’s no scheduling conflict
* Approve the extension
* Get your payment squared away on the spot

We’ll do our best to make it seamless, so the party never skips a beat.

**Pro Tip:** If you're considering a longer rental window, it's always best to **mention it during the booking process** so we can block off that time in advance and avoid overlaps.

Absolutely, we travel!

While **Lafayette, LA** is our home base and primary service area, **Ohh Snap! Photo Booth** has delivered unforgettable experiences across **South Louisiana** and beyond—from **photo booth rentals in Houston** to **Weddings in Mississippi**.

## So... What’s the Travel Fee?

Travel fees are based on a few key things:

* **Event location** (how far your venue is from Lafayette, LA)
* **Time of the rental** (especially if it's a late-night photo booth rental)
* **Additional logistics** (like setup, teardown, and overnight accommodations if needed)

Because each rental is unique, the travel cost can vary. A wedding at a venue in Baton Rouge and a festival in Lake Charles with a midnight breakdown won't have the same pricing structure. Our goal is to give you the most accurate and transparent quote possible.

## The Best Way to Get an Accurate Quote?

Just [fill out our Get a Quote form](https://ohhsnapbooth.com/contact/) and tell us a little about your event! We’ll review your details and send over custom pricing—including any **photo booth travel fees**—based on your location and needs.

Whether you're planning a **wedding in Acadiana**, a **brand activation in New Orleans**, or a **birthday party in Houston**, we’re happy to go the extra mile—literally—to make your event unforgettable.

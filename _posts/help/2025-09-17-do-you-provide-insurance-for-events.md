Yes—we can provide an insurance certificate for your event.

From **school events to large festivals**, every organizer has liability on their mind. Booking the cheapest option may save money up front, but it can also open the door to costly problems later if the vendor isn’t insured.  

That’s why **Ohh Snap! Photo Booth** is always ready to provide proof of insurance when requested. Many venues, cities, and schools require this as part of their rental agreement, and we’re happy to give you the documentation you need for peace of mind.

## Why Insurance Matters
- **Protects your event:** If something unexpected happens, you’re covered.  
- **Meets venue requirements:** Many venues won’t allow vendors without it.  
- **Shows professionalism:** Working with insured vendors demonstrates that your event is being handled with care.  

## How to Request It
When booking your photo booth, simply let us know if your venue requires an insurance certificate. We’ll provide it quickly so you can check one more thing off your planning list.

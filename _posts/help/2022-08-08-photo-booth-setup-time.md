While you have the option to add early setup for additional convenience, we typically aim to have our staff arrive one hour before your scheduled run time. This timeframe allows us to set up and thoroughly test all equipment, ensuring everything is ready for your event. It also alleviates the need for you to coordinate early arrivals, creating a smoother experience for everyone involved. Weâ€™ve found this approach to be the most effective and efficient for both you and our team, allowing us to deliver the best service possible.

        <p class="text-muted">
          At Ohh Snap, generosity is part of who we are. Over the years, we’ve
          had the privilege of partnering with local schools, churches,
          non-profits, and community organizations to create moments that matter.
          Whether it’s helping raise funds, celebrate milestones, or bring joy
          to those who serve others — we’re here for it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          That said, we receive many donation requests throughout the year.
          While we wish we could say “yes” to all of them, our goal is to invest
          where we can make the most meaningful impact. This page explains how
          we partner with organizations, what we consider when reviewing
          requests, and how you can apply for donation or discounted support.

<!-- BEFORE REQUEST -->

      <div class="col-lg-9">
        <h3 class="h2 mb-4 text-center">Before You Request Support</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We know how much heart and effort goes into planning community events,
          and we appreciate every organization that reaches out. To keep our
          giving sustainable, we review each request using three guiding
          principles:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-muted mb-4">
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> We prioritize causes that make a local
            impact — especially those that give back to children, families, or
            the greater Lafayette and surrounding communities.</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> We look for ways to help you not only
            capture photos, but grow awareness, increase attendance, and connect
            with donors or sponsors.</li>
          <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Every booth requires time, staffing,
            and equipment. Even discounted or donated events represent a
            significant cost. We partner with organizations who value and
            respect that investment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted">
          If you’re planning an event that aligns with our mission, we’d love to
          explore how we can help — whether that’s a fully sponsored activation,
          partial discount, or creative partnership that benefits everyone
          involved.

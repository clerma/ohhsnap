I"Ï<p>We had a great time with Opelousas Catholic this past weekend! This mother/son dance was full of life and fun memories! The kids loved Ohh Snapâ€™s superhero props and especially loved the giraffe mask! Our gold-colored sequined photo booth backdrop fit perfectly with the theme and colors of the dance! An open-air photo booth is an awesome way to capture the fun at any kind of event, and we had a blast at this one! See ya in April, Opelousas Catholic!</p>

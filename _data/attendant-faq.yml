- question: "How do I get paid?"
  answer: "We pay all of our staff via Cash App. Payments are generally processed a few days after we receive the equipment back, or at the latest, within a week, depending on how busy we are. If you do not have Cash App, please download it <a href='https://cash.app/app/BXMGMDG'>here</a>. If you already have an account, please text Ashley your Cash App handle so we can ensure youâ€™re set up for payment. "

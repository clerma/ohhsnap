    "We used Ohh Snap Booth for my brother's wedding! Best decision ever! We got
    some amazing photos that were hysterical, but what's nice is that the photo
    quality and lighting are so good that we were able to take really nice/more
    formal family photos too! And you don't have to worry if it's going to be a
    good picture because it is like taking a selfie so you already know what
    you're going to get! I was also impressed that they print off the photos for
    you right then and there or you could email, text, or Facebook the photos
    right away! Simple & fun rolled into one! You should definitely use Ohh Snap
    Booth for all your events!"

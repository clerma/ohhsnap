    We loved Oh Snap!! We had them come to our wedding in early January and they
    truly made the night a blast. Our guests absolutely loved it, I am pretty
    sure there was a line of people for it the entire night! Definitely a very
    effective way to make your wedding fun and memorable!

    We used Ohh Snap Booth for my brother's wedding! Best decision ever! We got
    some amazing photos that were hysterical, but what's nice is that the photo
    quality and lighting are so good that we were able to take really nice/more
    formal family photos too! And you don't have to worry if it's going to be a
    good picture because it is like taking a selfie so you already know what
    you're going to get! I was also impressed that they print off the photos for
    you right then and there or you could email, text, or Facebook the photos
    right away! Simple & fun rolled into one! You should definitely use Ohh Snap
    Booth for all your events!

    We hired the Ohh Snap Social Booth for our recent non-profit event. The
    booth made it easy for our guests to retrieve photos & promote our sponsors
    online. Clean graphics, professional service, and gave us an extra 30
    minutes! We will be booking again next year! Thank you Ohh Snap Booth!

    Best open-air photobooth setup around! Ohh Snap Booth are a delight to work
    with from start to finish. From booking, designing the print template to the
    end of the event. They made sure our process was easy and effortless. Their
    fun backdrop selections are amazing as well. Take a look at their website
    and you will see why. Thank you!

    Used Ohh Snap twice... once for my wedding and the second time at an event
    for my job. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect and professional
    experience. Carlos and Ashley really go above and beyond to make sure you
    get EXACTLY what you want. Photo booth is definitely the life of the party!
    Can't wait for a reason to book with them again ❤️
